            Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. The theoretical difference between the two is
            that
            scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. For example, normally, a
            C
            program needs to be compiled before running whereas normally, a scripting language like JavaScript or PHP
            need
            not be compiled.
        </p>

        <p>
            Generally, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs because they are first converted native
            machine code. Also, compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively that
            the
            code might have, but the interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and
            halts
            at that very instance if there is some error. In practice, the distinction between the two is getting
            blurred
            owing to improved computation capabilities of the modern hardware and advanced coding practices.

        <p class="jk">What is a Scripting Language?</p>


        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scripting languages help in automating various software apps, web pages in a browser, shell usage of an
                OS (operating system), etc. The scripting languages like VBScript, Perl, Javascript, etc., do not
                require compilation, and they have less access to any computer’s native abilities. It is because these
                rather run on an original programming language’s subset. An example here could be that the Javascript
                won’t have the ability to access your file system.</li>
            <li>Generally, a scripting language is interpreted. It doesn’t primarily focus on building applications- but
                it can render behavior to an application that already exists. It basically helps in writing codes for
                targeting a software system. Thus, it can also automate a given operation on any software system. So
                basically, scripts act as a set of instructions that target any software system.</li>
            <li>The scripting languages have eventually evolved and become more powerful. They now no longer create
                minute scripts for automating a software system’s operations. One can also use scripting languages for
                building rich applications. These can customize, manipulate, and automate an existing system’s
                facilities. The scripting languages come with a mechanism that exposes functionality to the program
                control.</li>

        <p class="jk">What is a Programming Language?</p>

        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>One needs to compile the programming languages to machine code so as to run them on the hardware of an
                underlying OS (operating system). A user needs to deploy a certain Integrated Development Environment
                (IDE) for using programming languages. A programmer needs to provide an instruction set for the
                computers for achieving certain goals. One can also implement certain algorithms by writing the
                programs.</li>
            <li>Out of all the programming languages present in the market, specific documentation dominates a majority
                of them. All the other languages comprise dominant implementation (treated as a reference). An example
                here is that the ISO standard associates with the C programming language. On the other hand, languages
                like Perl belong to the latter category.</li>
            <li>One can use a programming language for transforming data. It basically happens when creating those CPU
                instructions that jot down the input info into the output. An example here is using a set of conditions
                for solving an equation set. One can consider various programming languages such as C, C++, Scala, Java,
                etc., as general-purpose languages. These fall under the compiled programming languages. You must add
                some texts to write the score code, and then you can run them through a compiler. As a result, it would
                create various binary instructions.</li>
